Overview
This repo contains everything inside the Assets folder of my game Knight and Slime that I'm making inside of unity. 
The main reason for this remote repo is for turning in my assisgnments without uploading large files and it allows me to edit my scripts from my phone.

Git Notes
I'm using an extension called git for unity to faccilitate uploading my project directly inside of unity to this remote repo.
I'm also using Git LFS to store my large binary files such as images and sound in this repo. 
Since my free git LFS storage is almost up in the future if more remote Git LFS storage is needed for my this or future projects the best free option would be to set up a "remote repo" inside of google drive.

Project Team Expansion Notes
I intend to see this game through to publication eventually and as such some preparations need to be made to recruit people with the talents needed for my team.
As such these are the roles needed in the future when this is no longer just a school project:
Graphic Artist/Designer: 
Audio Mixer:
